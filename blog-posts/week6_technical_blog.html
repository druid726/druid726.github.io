							<p><strong>Comparing Functional vs. Object-Oriented Programming</strong></p>
							<p>Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data.</p>
							<p>In other words:</p> 
								<ul>
									<li>Functional programming utilizes functions to produce results that depend solely on the input and not on the program state.</li>
									<li>Programming is done with expressions, making it a declarative programming paradigm. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) both times.</li>
									<li>Functional programming eliminates side effects, which can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program. This is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p> Object-oriented programming is an approach to designing modular, reusable software systems.
								<ul> 
										<li>The key to the object-oriented approach is modeling.</li>
										<li>Objects correspond to things found in the real world.</li>
										<li>Rather than structure programs as code and data, an object-oriented system integrates the two using the concept of an "object".</li>
										<li>An object has state(data) and behavior(code).</li>
									</ul>	
								</p>

							<p>This is an extraordinarily shallow and brief list of the differences between Functional and Object-Oriented Programming but since I have no experience with the former and am just beginning to learn, much less, understand the latter I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.</p>
