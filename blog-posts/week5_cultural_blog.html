							 <h3>Pairing</h3>
								<p><strong>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</strong></p>
								<p>For the most part I really enjoy pairing.  The exchanging of ideas and trying things out in the irb is really helpful to me.  It's a great way to learn new methods and see how someone else approaches a problem.  I find it is especially helpful when both partners are around the same level.  I really enjoy be able share some knowledge that I have and it forces me to solidify it into something I can explain to someone else rather than just operate on a fuzzy understanding of the concept. </p>
								<p><strong>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</strong></p>
								<p>I have been very fortunate that most of my pairing sessions have been with people who have a sense of humor and a willingness to try new things.  Right now I literally type in a line of code and then run it in irb or a driver test. So when it works there is joyous celebration.</p>
								<p><strong>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</strong></p>
								<p>Sometimes pairing can be frustrating when the other person's skill set is beyond mine.  Something that appears to them as a straight and logically procession looks to me like they skipped six or seven steps. I understand the basic concepts of what needs to be but I still struggle with how to communicate that to the computer. Most people have been very generous with their time and their knowledge but they write code that doesn't really need refactoring and I need to have every step coded out.  It is also very frustrating and rude when people do not respond to an email request for a pair session.  I understand how time consuming this can be on top of outside obligations scheduling a session can be difficult but to just ignore someone..really? This has happened at least once with both of my accountability groups.</p>

							<h3>Feedback</h3>
								<p><strong>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</strong></p>
								<p>I was nervous at first to read my feedback but it has been pretty positive. It's good to hear that the other person had a similar experience to mine.  </p>
								<p><strong>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</strong></p>
								<p>Not really - the sessions themselves have been helpful but only one person actually offered some helpful advice.</p>
								<p><strong>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to 
								do to improve next time you pair?</strong></p>
								<p>Two of the issues that have appeared in my feedback have been &ndash; that I am more comfortable driving (which is true) and that I don't express myself clearly and concisely.  This is also true since I don't have a solid grasp on what I am learning.  I have consciously tried to navigate more and take more time thinking about what I am trying to say.</p>
								<p><strong>How was it to write feedback?</strong></p>
								<p>Very difficult.  As I have previously stated most of my experiences have been positive so I don't really have anything to add other than great job or it was fun; can't wait to pair again. </p>
								<p><strong>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</strong></p>
								<p>Trying to find something helpful to say or offer advice on improving an aspect of the session.</p>
								<p><strong>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</strong></p>
								<p>Overall, I enjoy pairing but as we move forward into Ruby I feel like I am falling behind and am more afraid to pair up.  </p>
