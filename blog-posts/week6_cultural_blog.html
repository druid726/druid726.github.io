						<h3>Stereotype Threat As Seen by the "Mature" Female</h3>
							<h4>21 June 2014</h4>
							<p>I was surprised to discover what a Stereotype Threat actually is and it wasn't what I originally thought. It seems to be more of a self-fullfilling prophecy than an outright bias. And it's impact, whether intentional or not, is directly controlled by the person exposed to it. </p>

							<p>Have I experienced it &ndash; yes and it sucks. Most recently at my last job.  I was working for this company about 8 years and had received good reviews and bonuses and new job titles with increased responsibility and I felt secure and well liked. The company was taking a new direction and they hired someone from the outside. I was interviewing with the woman I would be reporting to and she called me "seasoned" referring to my age and making it seem like a positive. You know having experience and knowledge etc. It was the first time my age had ever been a factor and I was shocked by it. I didn't realize how much it effected me until seven months later when I was offered a package and left the company with tears in my eyes and my tail between my legs. She put me on edge, it was the first time I could recollect having to defend an aspect of my identity as an adult. I never had a problem being a woman; I had more of an issue not going to an Ivy League School. The only time being a woman was a disadvantage was pissing contests and playing sports. And I don't care for either. I can't even tell what she did that put me so on edge and defensive other than hiring a boatload of people all younger than me. I never recieved any feedback and soon she just began ignoring me. It was not a surprise when I was offered a package.</p>

							<p>What would I do if, more likely, when I am confronted with any type of Stereotype Threat whether intentional or not? I'm not completely sure. Being surrounded by people who have different experiences and opinions and expectations and goals is necessary for growth but as I have gotten older I realize that I want to work with people who do share a lot of my experiences, views, expectations and goals. That is not to say I want to work with only middle-aged, overweight, single women who have dogs instead of children and love to crochet. And yes I am a bit of a stereotype &mdash; where did you think they came from? Honestly I'm not out to change the world &mdash; I wouldn't want to work somewhere I did not fit in regardless of the reason why. Am I foolish to think that there is a place for me where there is the perfect balance of homogeneity and diversity? I hope not.</p>  
  
							<p>How does one remedy the situation whether intentional or not? Feedback, as a dialog, is not only a good start but the most effective way to address it.  Any open form of communication is beneficial, it may not alleviate the threat, real or presumed, but it should address any concerns. It may be that this environment is not for you and it may not be because of any "Stereotype Threat". It may be you have different expectations or goals not that you are male or female or black, white or Asian.  And the sooner you know that the better.</p>
