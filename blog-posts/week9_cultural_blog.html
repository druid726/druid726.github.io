							<p><strong>How to ask a good question?</strong></p>

							<p>With computer software, platforms and devices constantly changing and improving, this is probably the most overlooked skill in the world. Many of us are afraid to ask a question because we fear showing our ignorance and being subjected to a public humilation or being completely ignored and the question being overlooked. In defense of those answering our questions we should do everything we can to ensure that question is answerable.  To improve our chances of getting an answer, here are some tips:</p>

							<p><strong>Before You Ask</strong></p>

							<p>Before asking your question have you really tried to solve it on your own? Have you done any of the following?
								<ul>
									<li>Read the source code? Or documentation?</li>
									<li>Searched the Web? i.e., Googled it?</li>
									<li>Tried experimentating?</li>
									<li>Ask a friend or co-worker?</li>
								</ul>
							Be respectful of the time and knowledge from whom who are seeking assistance. When you ask your question, let them know that you have done these things first; this will establish that you're not being lazy and you're willing to complete the process if someone can just point you in the right direction.</p>

							<p>Now that you are ready to post/ask your question here are some more suggestions. 
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Take your time and think your question through.</strong> Poorly written questions get poorly written answers, or none at all. The more you do to demonstrate that having put thought and effort into solving your problem before seeking help, the more likely you are to actually get help.</li>

									<li><strong>State the problem before you post any code.</strong> Be precise and informative. In the body of your question, start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you're trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself.</li>

									<li><strong>Proof-read before posting!</strong>
									Now that you're ready to ask your question, take a deep breath and read through it from start to finish. Pretend you're seeing it for the first time: does it make sense? Try reproducing the problem yourself, in a fresh environment and make sure you can do so using only the information included in your question. Add any details you missed and read through it again. Now is a good time to make sure that your title still describes the problem!</li>

									<li><strong>Post the question and respond to feedback.</strong> After you post, leave the question open in your browser for a bit, and see if anyone comments. If you missed an obvious piece of information, be ready to respond by editing your question to include it. If someone posts an answer, be ready to try it out and provide feedback!</li>
								</ul>
