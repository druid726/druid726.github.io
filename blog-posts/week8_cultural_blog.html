					<h2>Week 8 of Phase 0</h2>

							<h4>05 July 2014</h4>
							<p>Conflict, emotional conflict. I don't handle conflict of any sort well.  My last conflict is why I am where I am today.  It happened at work, a new secretary was brought in around the time my father was diagnosed with cancer.  I needed time off and my boss suggested I give some of the work to this new secretary.  I was the Assistant Facilities Manager and I was highly insulted that my boss thought a secretary could handle my job, especially a new secretary.  I had an instant and intense dislike of this woman which never abated even after my father passed away and the secretary was transferred to another department.</p>

							<p>For me this was a confluence of issues that merged at a time of personal and family crisis. I had ignored my inner self or compass and had not realized earlier that this was a situation that I could not change or win. Up until that point I thought winning was important.</p>

							<p>The conflict had two main sources &ndash; poor communication with my boss and the secretary's unacknowledged subpar performance.  My boss was the Head of Business Services and the Office Supervisor and I split the Facilities Manager's responsibilities. My boss never understood the responsibilities of the position and I didn't run to her with every little thing. I had followed my bosses suggestion to have the secretary do some of my work while I was out on leave. Most of the work needed to be redone.  It wasn't that I was angry she couldn't complete the work, I was angry because she never asked for help and my boss had no clue as to what was involved.</p>

							<p>My relationship with my boss suffered greatly after this incident. I was very angry and began to resent her. We fought constantly, I challenged her on everything when previously I would politely listen and then go do what I thought was right. I hated her so much that I took another position in the company and left her hanging. I went back to being a secretary, which was stupid for a variety of reasons, chief among them was I hadn't been a secretary in almost 20 years. I apparently sucked at it since I was laid-off five months later.</p>

							<p>I think it goes without saying that I did not handle this well. I avoided the issue and withdrew from my boss, attacked the secretary and myself to a lesser degree. I had known for the longest time that this situation was not good for me. I was not going to be promoted; my boss may not have known everything I did but she did know enough to keep me. I knew the culture of the company was in direct conflict with my values but I stayed mainly because I was too lazy to take a good, hard look at myself and make some significant changes.</p>

							<p>Looking back on it I realize the conflict wasn't with my boss or the secretary but with myself. I am not attacking myself &ndash; both my boss and the secretary have work performance issues but the conflicts I had were messages to myself that things were not right for me.</p>

							<p>I have learned to listen to myself more closely. Sometimes conflicts can be resolved with open and honest communication and sometimes you realize that they can not be resolved at all.</p>
