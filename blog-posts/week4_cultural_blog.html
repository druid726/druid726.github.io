						<h3>Reforms to the CFAA</h3>
							<h4>8 June 2014</h4>
							<p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (first enacted in 1986) is a dangerously vague and broad law &mdash; so much so that simply lying about your age on Facebook, or otherwise violating a website's terms of service or an employer's computer use policy, could be prosecuted as a federal crime.  The original scope was to protect average Internet users and better target malicious hackers by making crimes out of stealing passwords, accessing computers without permission, knowingly transmitting code that intentionally causes damage, interfering with interstate commerce et al.  Unfortunately the scope has been broaden since 1986 to include any violation of a website's term of service or user's agreement (you know the one that nobody reads and automatically accepts) and the federal penalties have increased to include jail time, fines and confiscation of personal property.</p>

							<p>This federal law and its mandated penalties are believed to cause the suicide of Aaron Swartz, a computer-programmer, teacher and activist. On January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested by MIT police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after systematically downloading academic journal articles from JSTOR. Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and 11 violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution and supervised release.</p>

							<p>His death has prompted calls for reform and the introduction of Aaron's Law.  This new law would clarify and narrow the scope to exclude the term's of service violations.  There are also reform bills pressing for more just and proportionate penalties.  These are currently stalled in Congress.</p>

							<p>The World Wide Web was originally created to allow educational organizations access current research.  It's very foundation is the exchange of information.  While unauthorized access to personal information and the disruption of commerce should be and are crimes that carry penalties and jail time; the CFAA, as it stands now, is too broad in scope and opens the door to criminalization of the most benign and innocuous acts. In the offline world contract violations are not felonies &nash; they shouldn't be in the online world either.</p>
