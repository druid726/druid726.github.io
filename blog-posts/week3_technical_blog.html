							<h3></h3>
								<h4>31 May 2014</h4>
							<p>JavaScript is the programming language used to build advanced Web sites and applications.  Its popularity is derived from the ease of use, making web pages interactive, enabling faster response times and its flexibilty allows for use with multiple paradigms (including mobile devices) and both client-side and server-side servers with third-party frameworks and libraries.</p>

							<p>What's JavaScript Good For?</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Livening pages up &ndash; enhancing websites and making them interactive</li>
								<li>Data entry validation &ndash; it can validate the format of credit cards, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.</li>
								<li>Handling cookies &ndash; storing information on the user's machine</li>
							</ul>

							<p>What's JavaScript Not So Good For?</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Security &ndash; JavaScript snippets allow outside access to the user's system</li>
								<li>Search Engine Optimization &ndash; search spiders cannot follow JavaScript links so the page might not show up in a search</li>
								<li>Rendering &ndash; JavaScript may render differently on different browsers resulting in inconsistencies with functionality and interfaces</li>
							</ul>

							<p>There are many reasons to use JavaScript, it provides benefits to the user, the programmer and both the client and server sides.  And while the downsides can be significant there are many third-party frameworks and add-ons to combat them.</p>
