					<h2>Week 7 of Phase 0</h2>
						<h3>What do I value the most?</h3>
							<h4>04 July 2014</h4>
							<p>In this exercise I am to choose several adjectives that describe how I felt at my happiest, proudest or most satisfied.  I narrowed my original list of 28 down to these core adjectives: achievement/accomplishment, creativity, decisiveness, efficiency, honesty/openness and reliability/responsibility.</p>
							<h3>Achievement and Accomplishment</h3>
						 	<p>These words are very similar and both have French etymology. They mean a lot to me mainly because I am a task oriented person. I have a sense of accomplishment when completing simple, daily tasks i.e., grocery shopping, walking the dogs, cleaning the house, laundry etc. But achievement is something a little more, its a long-term goal. Completing Phase 0 of this bootcamp will be an achievement for me. These things instill a great sense of pride in me as well as a sense of empowerment and security.</p>
						 	<p>
						 	I was asked if I try to live up to these values every day, I think one would be an idiot to admit that they don't live by the values they have chosen as important.  And yes I try every day &ndash; I am not always successful but on bad days I still rate a 3 on a 1 to 5 scale.</p>
							<p>
							As far as using my values to counteract a stereotype threat, I don't know.  I have lived and worked long enough to know that sometimes you have to choose between your values and what the world or office or whatever is offering or views as acceptable.  And from my experience choose your values &ndash; you will be happier and healthier in the long run.  And don't think you are alone; it may take awhile but there are others out there who hold the same values and you will find them.</p>
