						<h3>SQL versus NoSQL</h3>
							<h4>04 July 2014</h4>
							<p><strong>What is SQL?</strong></p>
							<p>SQL is an acronym for Structured Query Language and is used for managing data held in a relational database management system. SQL has two components one: a data definition language and the other: a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. The data is stored in tables with rows much like a spreadsheet and the column titles must be set beforehand.  Data is usually broken up into several different tables and depending on the data requested the tables will need to be joined for the requested data to be retrieved.</p>

							<p><strong>NoSQL Databases Explained</strong></p>

							<p>NoSQL, or 'Not Only SQL', represents the new class of data management technologies designed to meet the increasing volume, velocity, and variety of data that organizations are storing, processing, and analyzing.</p>

							<p>Compared to relational databases, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior performance. NoSQL databases address the opportunities that the relational model does not, including:
								<ul>
									<li>Large volumes of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data</li>
									<li>Agile sprints, quick iteration, and frequent code pushes</li>
									<li>Flexible, easy to use object-oriented programming</li>
									<li>Efficient, scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture</li>
									<li>Dynamic Schemas</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
						
						<h4>SQL versus NoSQL</h4>
							<p>There really doesn't seem to be significant reason to choose SQL over NoSQL.  Based on the differences listed below NoSQL appears to come out the clear winner.
							<p><strong>NoSQL</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>NoSQL databases are more scalable</li>
									<li>NoSQL databases are built to allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema</li>
									<li>NoSQL databases scale horizontally, by adding servers instead of concentrating more capacity in a single server</li>
									<li>NoSQL databases support automatic replication</li>
								</ul>
							<p><strong>SQL</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>SQL databases require that schemas be defined before you can add data</li>
									<li>SQL databases usually scale vertically &ndash; a single server has to host the entire database to ensure reliability and continuous availability of data</li>
									<li>SQL databases need to be taken offline to update</li>
									<li>SQL databases require separate applications to manage replication</li>
								</ul>
