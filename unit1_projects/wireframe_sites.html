<h1>IMDB.com</h1>
	<h2>What problem is the web page solving?</h2>

	<p>The IMDb website is a database for accessing information on the entertainment industry specifically Movies and TV and the people who make it work.</p>
	
	<h2>What visual challenges are there?</h2>

	<p>There are many visual challenges to this site, it has a LOT of information, which updates daily, as well as advertising.  I think the page is very well designed as most of the images and a lot of the text are links to more information. Since the information updates so often it is important that the layout remain fixed.</p>
