		<h2>How the hell did I get here?</h2>
			<p>I like scenic routes which is good because that is all I seem to take.  No 'the shortest distance between two points is a straight line' for me!! I have a BA in Art History (no Obama jokes please) and was fortunate enough to work for the <a href="http://www.moma.org/"> Museum of Modern Art</a>.  Which was <b>awesome</b>!!  I had the opportunity to meet aritists I had read about and see their work up close.  Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to eat.  The pay was on the low scale -- like shoe budget was higher the annual pay low.</p>
			<p>I jumped ship and landed in Wall Street/Corporate America wasteland working as a Secretary/Word Processor/Desktop Publisher. <i>Icky</i>.  After several years I become frustrated and bored and was actually relieved to be laid-off.  So I spent a lot of free time playing on the computer and taking on-line courses in web design.  I finally bit the bullet and got serious about making this career change and dedicate myself to becoming a developer. I didn't find DBC, DBC sort of found me.  I meet a graduate of the Chicago program a few months ago at a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Ruby-Women" title="NYC Ruby Women meet-up page" target="_blank">NYC Ruby Women meet-up</a> and she sold me on the idea. And that's the abridged story of how I got here.</p>
		<h4>Ladies in the NY Cohort</h4>
			<p><a href="mailto:pdoneill26@gmail.com">Email me</a> if you have any questions about the meet-up or if you are planning on attending the next meeting on June 16.  Maybe we could meet-up beforehand.<br>  Sorry guys - it's ladies only.</p>
