						<h3>Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>
							<h4>31 May 2014</h4>
							<p>I should start out with a disclosure &ndash; I think many of these tests are nothing more than pop-psychology BS.  Having said that let's begin.  I took the test twice &ndash; mainly because I wasn't sure what my first results were and secondly to see if the results were consistent; they were not.  My Perceptual Quality changed but both times my Ordering Ability was sequential which I find surprising.  I am more of a trial and error person and very often skip steps (most notably planning stages) and will start in the middle or end of project.  To be honest my test scores were very close together 36(CS), 32(AS), 32(AR), 20(CR) so it makes sense that I would identify with many of the characteristics listed in each of the categories.  Upon further reflection I do see why I scored the highest in the Concrete Sequential even though it is a tie with Concrete Random when it comes to the 'What's hard for them?' section.  </p>
							<p>As far as applying my 'thinking style' to DBC uhm...it is true that I think in a linear pattern; I visualize the final product and then work backwards.  So pre-planning exact steps doesn't really work for me.  Wireframing is a perfect example of that -- the finished product usually bears no resemblance to the initial wireframe.  So the most difficult part of Phase 0 has been the pre-planning.  Wireframing and pseudocde.  I usually complete the problem first and then go back to do the wireframing or pseudocode.  I don't believe that I charge in to tackle a problem willy-nilly but, I admit, I have reinvented the wheel on a number of occasions.  So I do need to be more disciplined about pre-planning especially pseudocode.  It does help with understanding the problem and potential solutions even more so with more complex issues. </p>

							<h3>Fixed versus Growth Mindset</h3>
							<p>As I was reading the article it occurred to me that I have both a fixed mindset (when I was younger) and a growth mindset (as I get older).  I don't believe it is experience that is changing my mindset as much as it is a unshackling of my natural way of thinking.  Looking back both of my parents, my mother most especially, have a fixed mindset.  This was reinforced by the educational system and the Corporate America through the first two-thirds of my life (so far).  This whole process &mdash; DBC &mdash; is an attempt to become a more well-rounded person and thinker.  I didn't sign up for this to learn coding &mdash; I signed up because I needed a new way of looking at and solving problems.  It is a relief to find a group of people on the same journey (whether they realize it or not) and not to have all the answers to the problems but just to understand them.  In the first three weeks of the Phase 0 I have become much more open about my lack of knowledge.  I was petrified when I discovered that I was going to have to pair-program and write my thoughts and fears down and share them with other people!!!  Now I look forward to it; even the feedback!  That is what will make me a more well-rounded person and efficient thinker.  And a kick-ass programmer.</p>
