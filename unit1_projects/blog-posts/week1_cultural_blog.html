					<p>Watching Shereef's fireside chat really solidified much of what I thought about DBC.  I was hoping for a transformative experience and I think that is what I will be getting.  I had been studying on-line, went to meet-ups and hack and chats but I hadn't really learned anything (I'll admit it I occassionally copy and paste from Stackoverflow.) Shereef's emphasis on not exclusively teaching coding and languages but on developing the whole person who happens to be a software engineer; someone who is curious and passionate as well as compassionate, self-aware and who has empathy for others, someone who looks for solutions (kitchen chef) not results (restuarant patron).  That resonated with me. <p>
					<p>I am nervous about the next few months but excited.  We're off to see the Wizard...</p>
